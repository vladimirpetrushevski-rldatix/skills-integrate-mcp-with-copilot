# Activities File

Refactor the codebase to load activities from a separate file (e.g., `activities.json`) instead of hardcoding them in the JavaScript or HTML. This will make it easier to update and manage the list of available activities. Ensure the activities are dynamically loaded and displayed on the homepage.
